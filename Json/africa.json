This gargantuan tomb was constructed about 4,500 years ago and has stood the test of time, becoming a symbol for Ancient Egyptian culture. With an estimated 2.3 million stones blocks, scientists and archaeologists today are still unsure HOW the ancient Egyptians were physically able to build this mammoth structure. Egypt has over a hundred pyramids, but the Great Pyramid is by far the largest of them all, in fact it is considered one of the largest structures ever built. Pharaohs were believed to be somewhere between humans and the divine, and as such their burial was highly significant. The pyramids’ angled sides pointing towards the sky were designed to aid the Pharaohs soul ascending to the heavens. Tombs were filled with treasures and valuables, to bring with them into the afterlife. This fact has intrigued explorers for hundreds or years, and many have devoted their lives trying to discover hidden pyramids and their accompanying treasure.",

The extensive stone ruins of this African Iron Age city are located in the southeastern portion of the modern-day country of Zimbabwe. It is thought that the central ruins and surrounding valley supported a Shona population of 10,000 to 20,000 people. The site is known for its stonework and other evidence of an advanced culture. Because of that, it was incorrectly attributed to various ancient civilizations such as the Phoenicians, the Greeks, or the Egyptians. Those claims were refuted when the English archaeologist and anthropologist David Randall-MacIver concluded in 1905 that the ruins were medieval and of exclusively African origin. His conclusions were later confirmed by another English archaeologist, Gertrude Caton-Thompson, in 1929.",

The city was founded by Tuaregs around 1100 CE, later became part of the Mali Empire, and then changed hands several times after that. Three of western Africa’s oldest mosques—Djinguereber (Djingareyber), Sankore, and Sidi Yahia—were built there during the 14th and early 15th centuries; Djinguereber was commissioned by the famed Mali emperor Mūsā I. The city was a center of Islamic learning and housed a large collection of historical African and Arabic manuscripts, many of which were smuggled out of Timbuktu beginning in 2012, after Islamic militants who had seized control of the city began damaging or destroying many objects of great historical and cultural value.",
